# TF2-bot-navigation
Bot navigation files for some TF2 maps

## Invasion Update

The status of the included nav files

* '''arena_byre''': Bots will react to enemies and move around the map, but only just enough to get out of sight.  They will not capture points and are essentially worthless.
* '''ctf_2fort_invasion''': Works
* '''koth_probed''': Works
* '''pd_watergate''': Doesn't work.  Bots do not have the appropriate AI for pd maps, so they just sit in spawn.


## Gun Mettle Update

The status of the included nav files

* '''cp_powerhouse''': Works
* '''cp_snowplow''': Barely works - Bots don't cap the points and get stuck on non-static props, such as the train
* '''koth_suijin''': Works well
* '''pl_borneo''': Works okay
